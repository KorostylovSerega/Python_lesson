Ukrainian officials say battles continue around Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, as Russian forces make incremental gains in the area. At least one person was killed on Wednesday after a two story hotel was partially destroyed in the shelling. In the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the mayor said two Russian missiles hit the city industrial district.
 Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are targeting the key Antonivskyi Bridge that is used to reinforce and resupply occupying Russian forces in southern Ukraine, according to officials. Moscow is deploying additional forces to its positions in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the southern part of the country, according to Ukrainian officials and videos posted on social media that were geolocated by CNN. Here what else to know:
 Russian troops wounded or killed: United States House lawmakers who attended a classified briefing Wednesday on Ukraine said Biden administration officials informed them that more than 75000 Russians have been killed or wounded during the war on Ukraine. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who serves on the House Armed Services Committee and recently visited Ukraine, told CNN that the conversation in the briefing included "what more we can and should be doing for the Ukrainians, literally in the next three to six weeks, very urgently." Lawmakers were also told that the Russian military is fatigued, but Ukrainians are looking for additional reinforcements as they aim to launch a counteroffensive in the south before the winter.
Western assistance: The Ukraine national security adviser said the country used some of the equipment and weapons donated by the US and other western countries to target the Antonivskyi bridge, in the Kherson region. Moscow has warned of "more than serious" consequences if Ukraine uses US made multiple launch rocket systems or other NATO supplied long range weapons against Russian territory, according to Russian official Konstantin Gavrilov.
 Possible release of Americans: After months of internal debate, the Biden administration has offered to exchange Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms trafficker serving a 25 year US prison sentence, as part of a potential deal to secure the release of two Americans held by Russia, Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, according to people briefed on the matter. These sources told CNN that the plan to trade Bout for Whelan and Griner received the backing of US President Joe Biden after being under discussion since earlier this year. Biden support for the swap overrides opposition from the Department of Justice, which is generally against prisoner trades. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday that the US presented a "substantial proposal" to Moscow "weeks ago" for Whelan and Griner, who are classified as wrongfully detained. Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Blinken said Biden was "directly involved" and signed off on the proposal. Blinken did not directly confirm Bout was part of the deal, saying he "can't and won't get into any of the details of what we proposed to the Russians over the course of so many weeks now." The top US diplomat said he intended to discuss the matter on an expected call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov this week his first conversation with his counterpart since the war in Ukraine began.
 Reduced gas supplies to Europe: The Russian energy giant Gazprom has imposed a further cut on gas flows to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of maximum capacity, German network operator Gascade said in a statement Wednesday. The Russian state owned energy company said on Monday that gas flows would be reduced as it shuts down a turbine for repairs, but EU officials said the decision was "politically motivated."
 Zelensky TV interview: In their first joint international TV interview, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and first lady Olena Zelenska told Britains TalkTV host Piers Morgan that their marriage had gotten stronger thanks to the challenges presented by the war. Zelensky also said he hopes the next British prime minister is a strong ally to Ukraine in light of Boris Johnson resignation.
